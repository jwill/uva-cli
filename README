Command line tool for the UVa Online Judge website

This is still incomplete yet.
Hopefully it will be done over the next few days when I'm free.


Features:
- Submit a file to the OJ through command line
- See your submissions
- See your statistics
- Password-less submissions

More features coming soon:
- Auto-retry submitting the solution (when UVA is down)
- Connects to UVAtoolkit
- Get statistics on a problem

Implementation:
Everything is written in C++ because I'm a hardcore C++ programmer. =p

Source code is included so you know there is no virus in it !

This should work across Windows and Linux based platforms.
It has a thin wrapper around the socket API.

Please let me know if there is any problem!
