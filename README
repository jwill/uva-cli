Command line tool for the UVa Online Judge website

UVA-CLI is an interactive shell where you can type commands to submit
and check your submissions.

Features
========
- Remembers your account info and encrypts your passwords.
- Password-less submission.
- Check most recent submission status.

Requirements
============
To run, you need Java Runtime 1.6 and above.
To check your java version, do "java --version" at the command line.
To build, please see BUILDING section.

Running
=======
A binary, ready-to-run version can be obtained from
    https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17243832/uva-cli-1.0.0-all.jar    

If you prefer to build it yourself, please see the Building section.

All dependencies are packaged in to the jar for your convenience.

Before you run, please generate an SSH key by following the instructions
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

The program assumes your private key is at ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
and it will use the key to encrypt all your account passwords.

Then to run, do "java -jar uva-cli-1.0.0-all.jar"

Building
========
To build, you'd need:
- Java JDK 1.6+
- libjava
- org.json
- Apache ANT: http://ant.apache.org/
- ANT-contrib: http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/

First, do a git clone https://github.com/lucastan/uva-cli.git

Apache ANT
----------
- Download and install according to instructions.

ANT-contrib
-----------
- Download the binary jar file and install in to the ANT directory.

libjava
-------
- git clone https://github.com/lucastan/libjava.git 
- Follow the instructions to build libjava-1.0.0.jar 
- Copy libjava-1.0.0.jar to the uva-cli/lib dir

org.json
--------
- git clone https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java
- Unfortunately, you have to build this manually by doing javac and jar
- Copy org.json.jar to the uva-cli/lib dir.

uva-cli
-------
- Do "git submodule init" and then "git submodule update"
- Then build this by typing "ant"
- You will get dist-1.0.0/uva-cli-1.0.0-all.jar

Usage
=====
Run the uva-cli-xxx-all.jar file at the command prompt.

UVA-CLI is an interactive shell which you can type commands.
Commands are of the syntax: <action> <arg1> <arg2> ...

Settings are saved in the JSON format at <home-dir>/.uva-cli
where <home-dir> is ~ on Linux systems. Please do not modify manually.
All passwords are encrypted
